<h2> Who Am I? </h2>

<p> I am Yin Yan (阎寅), a PhD. student of Computer Science and Engineering
Department at SUNY Buffalo. My research interest lies in the intersection
between the desgin of operating system and programming language runtime. My
PhD. reserch is about to enable real-time capability on Android platform, you
will find more details <a href="./phd-thesis.html">here.</a></p>


<p> I am passionate about programming and exploring different solutions for
problems that I encountered during my study and work. I believe a good
programmer should keep thinking of how to improve the runtime performance and
make code structure more elegant. This blog documents my thinking process and
discuss the rational/technic of my thought.</p>

that I have met during my research and work; 2) study summaries of my learning
