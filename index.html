<h2> Who Am I? </h2>

<p> I am Yin Yan (阎寅), a PhD. student of Computer Science and Engineering
Department at SUNY Buffalo. My research interest lies in the intersection
between the desgin of operating system and programming language runtime. My
PhD. reserch is about to enable real-time capability on Android platform, you
will find more details <a href="./phd-thesis.html">here.</a></p>

<p> I am a big fun of <strong><em>effective programming</em></strong>. </p>

<p>Programming is a craft. At its simplest, it comes down to getting a computer
to do what you want it to do (or what your user wants it to do). As a
programmer, you are part listener, part advisor, part interpreter, and part
dictator. You try to capture elusive requirements and find a way of expressing
them so that a mere machine can do them justice. You try to document your work
so that others can understand it, and you try to engineer your work so that
others can build on it. What's more, you try to do all this against the
relentless ticking of the project clock. You work small miracles every day.</p>

<p>It's a difficult job.</p>

<p>There are many people offering you help. Tool vendors tout the miracles
their products perform. Methodology gurus promise that their techniques
guarantee results. Everyone claims that their programming language is the best,
and every operating system is the answer to all conceivable ills. Of course,
none of this is true. There are no easy answers. There is no such thing as a
best solution, be it a tool, a language, or an operating system. There can only
be systems that are more appropriate in a particular set of circumstances. </p>

<p> This is where pragmatism comes in. You shouldn't be wedded to any
particular technology, but have a broad enough background and experience base
to allow you to choose good solutions in particular situations. Your background
stems from an understanding of the basic principles of computer science, and
your experience comes from a wide range of practical projects. Theory and
practice combine to make you strong. </p>

<p> You adjust your approach to suit the current circumstances and environment.
You judge the relative importance of all the factors affecting a project and
use your experience to produce appropriate solutions. And you do this
continuously as the work progresses. Pragmatic Programmers get the job done,
and do it well. </p>

<!-- I believe a good programmer should consider not only how to improve the
runtime performance, but also make code structure more elegant. This blog
documents my thinking process and discusses the rational/technic of my thought.

<h2> What Is This Blog About? </h2>

<p>There are three types of articles, 1) technical notes documenting solutions
that I have met during my research and work; 2) study summaries of my learning
process, 3) misc articles, everything else goes here. </p>
