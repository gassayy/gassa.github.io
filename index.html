<h2> Who Am I? </h2>

<p> I am Yin Yan (阎寅), a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering
Department at SUNY Buffalo. My research interest lies in the intersection
between the operating system and programming language runtime. My research
project, RTDroid, is about to enable real-time capability on Android platform,
you can find more details on <a href="./phd-thesis.html">my thesis page.
</a></p>

<p> Rather than a researcher in computer science, I prefer to identifying
myself as a programmer. I enjoy exploring different solutions and new
techniques for problems encountered during my research and study. During my
exploration, I am satisfied with not finding an answer to a particular question
or learning a cutting-edge technique, but the process of tracing the rational
behind the solution or the technique. It is interesting to document my thought
of solving problems and learning technologies. It is why I started this
blog.</p>

<h2> What Is This Blog About? </h2>

<p>There are three types of articles, 1) technical notes documenting solutions
for various problems that I have met during my research and work; 2) study
summaries of my learning process, 3) misc articles, everything else goes here.
