<h2> Who Am I? </h2>

<p> I am Yin Yan (阎寅), a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering
Department at SUNY Buffalo. My research interest lies in the intersection
between the operating system and programming language runtime. My research
project, RTDroid, is about to enable real-time capability on Android platform,
you can find more details on <a href="./phd-thesis.html">my thesis page.
</a></p>

<p>Rather than a researcher in computer science, I prefer to identifying myself
as a programmer. I explore new techniques and different solutions for problems
encountered in my research and study. I enjoy the process of learning a new
technique or finding a solution for a particular problem. However, the most
exciting part of my research is to trace the rationale behind the solution or
the technique, <sub>i.e.</sub>sub>, the reason why certain solution works or
better than others, or certain technique is needed.</p>

articles: 1) technical notes documenting solutions for various problems, 2)
study summaries of my learning process, 3) misc articles, everything else goes
