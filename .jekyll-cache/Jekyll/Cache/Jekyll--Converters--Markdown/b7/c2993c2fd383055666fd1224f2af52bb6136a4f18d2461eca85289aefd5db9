I"Ú<p>For example, if we convert an executable binary file to its text format with 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">objdump -s xxx.exe</code>, we then will get the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) 
of it. The ELF file contains <strong>symbols</strong>, eg. function names, global variables,
and etc., these symbols are orginzed into <strong>sections</strong> â€” code lives in one 
section (.text) and data in another (.data, rodata), then these sections are 
organized into <strong>segments</strong> or program headers. Addition to <code class="highlighter-rouge">objdump</code>, there 
are also other tools that can help us to explore the ELF file. Like, 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">readelf --segments exe</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">nm exe</code>. the <code class="highlighter-rouge">readelf</code> shows how an executable 
are segmented and loaded into memory. I don't want to include too much 
details here, instead I will summarize them in my next blog.</p>
