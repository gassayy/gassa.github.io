This post is comparing three functional languages from the sematic perspective
amount of standard ML, OCaml and Haskell. I will start with the standard ML
(NJ/SML), then compare SML with OCaml, a major implementation of ML with active
community and complete libraries. In my personal opinion, Ocaml is a pragmatic
verion of SML, it contains more syntactic sugars to eaze programming, but
induces slightly uglier code formation. Lately, I will compare Haskell with
these two MLs since Haskell is often quoted for a purier functional design.
Let's check out if the statement is held.


First of all, it is important to differentiate the core language premitives and
the syntatic sugars provided for the simplicity of programming. For example,
