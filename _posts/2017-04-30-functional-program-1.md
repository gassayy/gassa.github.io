This post is comparing three functional languages from the language sematics
and programming idioms amount of standard ML, OCaml and Haskell. I will start
with standard ML (NJ/SML), then compare SML with OCaml, a major implementation
of ML with active community and complete libraries. In my personal opinion,
Ocaml is a pragmatic verion of SML, it contains more syntactic sugars to
faciliate some programming idioms, but induces a slightly uglier code style.
Lately, I will use Haskell as complementories to introduce laziness, purity,
type classes and monads.
