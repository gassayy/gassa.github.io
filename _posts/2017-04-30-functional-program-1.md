This post is comparing three functional languages from the language sematics
and programming idioms amount of standard ML, OCaml and Haskell. I will start
with the standard ML (NJ/SML), then compare SML with OCaml, a major
implementation of ML with active community and complete libraries. In my
personal opinion, Ocaml is a pragmatic verion of SML, it contains more
syntactic sugars to eaze programming, but induces slightly uglier code
formation. Lately, I use Haskell as complementories for laziness. purity, type
classes and monads.


First of all, it is important to differentiate the core language premitives and
the syntatic sugars provided for the simplicity of programming. For example,
